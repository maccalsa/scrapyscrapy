# Scrapy Scrapy – Project Plan

## 1. Overview

**Scrapy Scrapy** is a multi-tenant web scraping platform that allows users to:
- Sign up, manage, and run scraping jobs.
- Schedule jobs with specific triggers (cron-like, on-demand, event-driven).
- Integrate analytics for performance, success rates, and progress tracking (similar to GitHub Actions).
- Store scraped data in a structured manner for further analysis or sharing.

This plan outlines the functional requirements, architecture, technologies, and phased roadmap to build this platform.

## 2. Project Goals and Vision

1. **Multi-user Platform**  
   Provide a secure environment where multiple users can create and run their own scraping workflows without interfering with each other.

2. **Flexible Scraping Workflows**  
   Allow the creation of highly configurable workflows that can handle different types of webpages and data extraction logic.

3. **Scalability and Performance**  
   - Handle multiple concurrent jobs with low latency.
   - Implement throttling controls to avoid overloading target sites and to comply with rate-limiting policies.

4. **Analytics and Monitoring**  
   - Offer real-time statistics on job execution progress.
   - Provide historical analytics on scraping success/failure rates and performance.

5. **Extensibility**  
   - Provide a plugin or modular system to easily integrate new parsers, data transformation logic, or output destinations.
   - Allow easy integration with third-party services and message brokers like Kafka.

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 High-Level Diagram

+----------------+ +---------------------+ +----------------+ | Client (UI) | --> | Scrapy Scrapy API | --> | PostgreSQL | | (or REST calls)| | (Spring Boot) | | (Data store) | +----------------+ +---------------------+ +----------------+ ^ | | v | Kafka (optional) | | | v | Analytics Processor | | +-------------------------+


1. **Scrapy Scrapy API**: Exposes endpoints for job creation, scheduling, and control.  
2. **PostgreSQL**: Stores user data, job metadata, scraping results.  
3. **Kafka (optional)**: Decouples data processing, allows real-time streaming analysis, logs, or multi-step pipelines.

### 4.2 Components

1. **Authentication & Authorization**  
   - Manages user sign-up, login, roles, permissions (potentially Spring Security + JWT or OAuth2).

2. **Scraping Engine**  
   - Executes scraping workflows using asynchronous, non-blocking I/O with WebFlux.
   - A pool of workers (reactive) fetches and processes pages concurrently.

3. **Job Scheduler**  
   - Allows users to set schedules (cron expressions or custom triggers).
   - Dispatches scraping tasks to the engine at the specified intervals.

4. **Analytics & Monitoring**  
   - Collects real-time and historical metrics (job success/failure, latency, data size, etc.).
   - If Kafka is used, an analytics microservice can subscribe to scraping events and persist them for reporting.

5. **Dashboard**  
   - Displays real-time progress of jobs (like GitHub Actions), with logs and statistics.
   - Offers user-friendly insights into scheduling, data extraction outcomes, and system performance.

## 6. Data Model (High-Level)

User
    - id (PK)
    - username
    - email
    - password (hashed)
    - roles (enum or join table)

Job

    - id (PK)
    - user_id (FK -> User)
    - name
    - schedule (cron expression)
    - active (boolean)
    - last_run_time
    - next_run_time

ScrapeResult

    - id (PK)
    - job_id (FK -> Job)
    - timestamp
    - status (success, fail, partial)
    - data (JSONB column or text)
    - logs (JSONB column or text)

Analytics (optional if Kafka is used)

    - event_id
    - job_id
    - event_type (job started, job finished, job error, etc.)
    - timestamp
    - metrics (JSONB)


> This is a simplified model. Real-world implementations might split out logs and events further for scalability.

## 8. Potential Challenges & Mitigation

1. **High Concurrency & I/O Bounds**  
   - Mitigation: Use non-blocking I/O (WebFlux) and asynchronous processing. Employ caching strategies and queue-based backpressure if needed.

2. **Target Website Variations**  
   - Mitigation: Flexible extraction strategies (CSS, XPath, custom scripts). Possibly use a headless browser for dynamic sites.

3. **Maintaining Schedules**  
   - Mitigation: Use a proven scheduling library (Quartz/Spring Scheduler). Keep state in the DB to handle restarts and failover.

4. **Security & Resource Abuse**  
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting & throttling. Implement robust authentication and user-level usage metrics. Possibly recoup costs via subscription tiers.

5. **Data Storage & Size**  
   - Mitigation: PostgreSQL partitions, or store heavy data (e.g., HTML) in an object store (e.g., S3). Regularly archive old data.

## 9. Implementation Best Practices

- **Use Reactive Streams End-to-End**: Ensure the entire pipeline (from request ingestion to DB write) supports non-blocking operations.
- **Containerization & Infrastructure as Code**: Docker for containerization, Helm or Terraform for deployment.
- **Logging & Observability**: Implement structured logging (JSON logs), use metrics (Micrometer), and distributed tracing if microservices are used.
- **Testing Strategy**: 
  - **Unit Tests**: Core scraping logic, data manipulation.
  - **Integration Tests**: Database interactions, job scheduling.
  - **End-to-End Tests**: Full user flow from job creation to data retrieval.
